# Bluetooth Controlled NeoPixel

I got Android codes from <a href="http://www.elektrobot.net/arduino-ile-android-kontollu-neopixel-led/" target="_blank">here</a> and changed the codes for my project, thanks Oğuzhan Başer!


I wrote Arduino codes by myself.

First, you have to download the Arduino code from /Arduino folder.
Then send these codes to Arduino. You can check the connection pins of HC-05 and NeoPixel from the codes.


Build the application and send&setup it to your phone.
